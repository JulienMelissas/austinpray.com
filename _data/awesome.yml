    Victory is an opinionated, but fully overridable, ecosystem of composable
    React components for building interactive data visualizations. This repo
    aggregates all of the stable Victory components so they can be conveniently
    included.

    For complex visualizations there is no doubt that d3 is king. But what
    about simple line charts, bar charts, and pie charts that live on
    dashboards and such? Victory is the best charting tool I have found for
    integrating with React projects. Well tested, professionally maintained by
    multiple employees of FormidableLabs.

    Hopscotch is a framework to make it easy for developers to add product
    tours to their pages. Hopscotch accepts a tour JSON object as input and
    provides an API for the developer to control rendering the tour display and
    managing the tour progress.

    This is the best user walkthrough module I have come across. Great test
    coverage and professionally maintained.
