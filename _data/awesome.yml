    Hopscotch is a framework to make it easy for developers to add product
    tours to their pages. Hopscotch accepts a tour JSON object as input and
    provides an API for the developer to control rendering the tour display and
    managing the tour progress.

    This is the best user walkthrough module I have come across. Great test
    coverage and professionally maintained.
