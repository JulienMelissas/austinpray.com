Went ahead and finally updated my site. I really needed a place to start
putting all the <del>novels</del> [github][long1] [comments][long2] [I
write][long3] in a nice place so they don't get lost.

## New Site

Nothing fancy, [see for yourself](https://github.com/austinpray/austinpray.com).

- Completely deleted my WordPress blog. It was running WordPress 3.6, had
  probably 30 or so posts about [who knows what][noonecares]. I only use
  WordPress for non-fun client projects anyway.
- Deleted my old site. It was first built like 3 years ago. I think I was using
  [codekit](https://incident57.com/codekit/) and [Skeleton
  1.2](https://github.com/dhg/Skeleton/tree/7ab682091d1032035cfcb668e6bd4b465bfa4679).
- [Read the docs like a good person should](https://help.github.com/articles/using-jekyll-with-pages/).
- `jekyll new .`
- Publish to GitHub pages.

The entire site is open source. When I start writing actually useful articles my
hope is that readers will easily be able submit corrections/suggestions.

## Old site

The old site [looked something like this][wayback]. The source for the old site
is [available here][old-site].
