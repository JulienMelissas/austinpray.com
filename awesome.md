### [linkedin/hopscotch](https://github.com/linkedin/hopscotch)

> Hopscotch is a framework to make it easy for developers to add product tours to their pages. Hopscotch accepts a tour JSON object as input and provides an API for the developer to control rendering the tour display and managing the tour progress.

This is the best user walkthrough module I have come across. Great test coverage and professionally maintained.
